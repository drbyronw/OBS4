PostgreSQL tables:

Stock Table:
Each individual stock exchange will include-
Idea is that each stock will get its own table, each with
one row of this information. If the bank buys a stock,
the respective table will be updated (update NUM_SHARES),
NUM_SHARES would decrease.
SYMBOL|NUM_SHARES

Banking Table:
SYMBOL|ASK_PRICE|NUM_SHARES|TOT_VALUE|KEY_USED

Idea is that each bank will have five rows, so each bank account will have 5 rows
The bank starts with 0 for NUM_SHARES and 0 TOT_VALUE,
If values are 0, the user cannot sell
If values are > 0, the user can buy and their NUM_SHARES will increase, ASK_PRICE will change accordingly,
and TOT_VALUE would give the ASK_PRICE * NUM_SHARES - mainly for finding networth easier.

Transaction Table:
TRAN_DATE|SYMBOL|ASK_PRICE|NUM_SHARES|TOT_VALUE|BUYORSELL|KEY_USED

KEY_USED is some token, maybe from the user's username and password

Idea is that every buy/sell transaction will include-
these fields, and a new row with the current timestamp
will be included.

User Table:
USERNAME|PASSWORD|ACCOUNT|KEY_USED|



If approved this will be used as the basis for the schemas.
